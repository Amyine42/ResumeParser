Resume Parser and Formatter - Development Plan
1. Project Setup
Initialize a Git repository for version control.

Set up a Python virtual environment (venv or conda).

Install required dependencies:

Flask for the backend.

pdfplumber for PDF text extraction.

python-docx for processing DOCX files.

spaCy or transformers for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

reportlab for PDF generation.

Define the project structure:

├── app.py          # Main Flask app
├── requirements.txt  # Dependencies
├── models/         # AI models for NLP
├── static/         # Static files (if needed)
├── templates/      # Placeholder for potential HTML templates
├── uploads/        # Temporary storage for uploaded resumes
├── outputs/        # Folder to store reformatted resumes
├── utils/          # Utility scripts (e.g., PDF/DOCX processing)
├── README.md       # Project documentation
├── config.py       # Configuration settings
2. Resume Upload & Processing
2.1 Upload API
Implement a /upload endpoint to accept PDF and DOCX resumes.

Validate uploaded files (only allow PDF/DOCX, enforce size limits).

Store uploaded resumes temporarily in the /uploads directory.

2.2 Text Extraction
PDF Processing: Use pdfplumber for extracting text from structured PDFs.

OCR Support: Use pytesseract for scanned PDFs.

DOCX Processing: Use python-docx to extract text from Word files.

Text Preprocessing: Remove unwanted characters, normalize encoding, and format text for parsing.

3. AI-Based Information Extraction
3.1 AI Model Selection
Use spaCy, BERT, or transformers-based models for Named Entity Recognition (NER).

Train or fine-tune the model to improve accuracy in resume parsing.

3.2 Key Information Extraction
Extract structured data from resumes:

Personal Information: Name, Email, Phone, LinkedIn.

Work Experience: Job Title, Company, Duration, Description.

Education: Degree, Institution, Years.

Skills: Extract technical and soft skills.

Certifications & Projects: Identify relevant certifications and major projects.

Convert extracted data into structured JSON format.

4. Resume Formatting & Output Generation
4.1 Standardized Formatting
Design a predefined template for structured resumes.

Maintain a clean, recruiter-friendly layout.

4.2 File Generation
Implement DOCX generation using python-docx.

Implement PDF generation using reportlab.

Map extracted JSON data into the predefined format.

Ensure correct section alignment, spacing, and styling.

5. Resume Download & Cleanup
5.1 Download Reformatted Resume
Create a /format endpoint that generates the final formatted resume.

Ensure users can download resumes in the same format as the input file (PDF or DOCX).

5.2 Automatic Cleanup
Delete temporary files after processing to save storage.

Implement auto-expiry for stored resumes to maintain privacy.

6. API Endpoints & Testing
6.1 API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/upload	Uploads a resume (PDF/DOCX).
POST	/format	Processes and reformats the resume.
GET	/resume/{id}	Retrieves parsed resume data in JSON.
6.2 Testing
Write unit tests using pytest.

Test with various resume formats (structured/unstructured, different layouts).

Handle error cases such as corrupted files, missing information, etc.
