The **Resume Parser and Formatter App** is designed to assist recruiters by transforming resumes into a structured, readable format. It leverages AI to extract key information such as **name, contact details, experience, education, skills, and certifications** from resumes in **PDF** or **DOCX** format and outputs a reformatted resume in the same format as the input.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Resume Upload & Processing

- Accept resumes in **PDF** and **DOCX** formats.
- Perform **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** for scanned PDFs.
- Use AI-based **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to identify sections and extract structured data.

### 2.2 Data Extraction

- **Personal Information**: Name, email, phone number, LinkedIn profile.
- **Work Experience**: Job titles, company names, durations, and descriptions.
- **Education**: Degree, institution, years attended.
- **Skills**: Hard and soft skills listed explicitly or inferred from experience.
- **Certifications**: Any relevant professional certificates.
- **Projects/Publications**: If mentioned, categorize them.

### 2.3 Resume Formatting & Output

- Generate the reformatted resume in the **same format as the input (PDF or DOCX)**.
- Ensure consistency and logical flow of information.

## 3. System Architecture

### 3.1 Backend

- **Tech Stack**: Python (Flask) for API.
- **AI Processing**:
  - Use **spaCy / BERT / GPT-based model** for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**.
  - Implement **LangChain** for contextual section identification.
  - Utilize **PyMuPDF / PDFPlumber** for parsing PDFs and **python-docx** for DOCX processing.
- **Storage**:
  - Store parsed resumes temporarily for recruiters to download.
  - No need for a database since resumes are processed and downloaded directly.

### 3.2 AI Model & Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Convert document to plain text (if PDF, use OCR if needed).
   - Identify and classify sections (personal details, experience, etc.).
2. **Extraction**:
   - Extract relevant data using AI models.
   - Normalize extracted information (e.g., date formats, job title standardization).
3. **Reformatting**:
   - Structure content into predefined sections.
   - Apply standardized formatting with appropriate headings and spacing.
4. **Output Generation**:
   - Convert structured data back to DOCX/PDF using **python-docx** and **reportlab**.

## 4. API Endpoints

### 4.1 Upload Resume

**POST /upload**

- **Input**: File (PDF/DOCX)
- **Output**: Parsed JSON response with extracted details.

### 4.2 Generate Reformatted Resume

**POST /format**

- **Input**: Parsed JSON data.
- **Output**: Reformatted resume (PDF/DOCX).

## 5. User Experience (UX) Flow

1. **User uploads resume** → AI processes and extracts data.
2. **User previews structured data** → Confirms correctness.
3. **User downloads reformatted resume** in a clean, predefined format.
